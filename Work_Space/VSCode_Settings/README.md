# VS Code settings

This directory contains all of my vs code's settings that I like and my custom snippet. I use windows machine for my development so I'm not sure about how to setup in MAC/Linus.

###

Just pest this folder to the following path to make your settings and snippet as mine.
`Path: C:\Users\<Your User Name>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User`
